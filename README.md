I am Master's student in UBC. I did my Bachelor's degree, also at UBC, with a combined major of Computer Science in Biology. My research was focused on drug discovery using machine learning and advacned simulations. Currently, I am researching with a focus on locomotion in robotics. 


- ðŸ§¬ Built **agent-based disease models** with reinforcement learning to simulate outbreaks and interventions
- ðŸ§  Ran billions of simulations using UBCâ€™s supercomputing cluster to train RL agents under variable infection rates and stochasticity levels.
-	ðŸ”— Integrated large-scale simulations with real-time dashboards for tracking agent learning progress, infection metrics, and policy shifts.
- ðŸš€ Passionate about *RL, LLMs, Transformer, synthetic biology**, and any system with rules and rebels
